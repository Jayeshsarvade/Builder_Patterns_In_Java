# 🎯 Java Design Patterns Project

This repository demonstrates **popular Java Design Patterns** with clean, well-documented code examples.  
Patterns are implemented step-by-step to help developers understand **best practices**, **object creation strategies**, and **design flexibility** in real-world software development.

## 📜 Overview

This project covers:

### 🔹 Creational Patterns
- **Abstract Factory** – Create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes.
- **Builder** – Simplify object creation with step-by-step construction.
- **Prototype (Shallow & Deep Copy)** – Clone objects with or without deep object graph duplication.
- **Singleton**
  - Eager Initialization
  - Lazy Initialization
  - Enum Singleton
  - Thread-Safe Singleton
  - Singleton with Reflection, Cloning, Serialization Handling

### 🔹 Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** – Convert interfaces of classes into a form clients expect.

### 🔹 Behavioral Patterns
- **Iterator** – Sequentially access elements without exposing internal structure.
- **Observer** – Establish a one-to-many dependency between objects.
